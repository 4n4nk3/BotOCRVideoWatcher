# BotVideoWatcher
A very simple bot written in python on Windows that use OCR to get the length of a video in a webplayer in order to watch it till the end and then watch the next one and so on.
This bot has been created out of boredom in order to automagically watch some very long and numerous mandatory videos and stop wasting time while still achieving the final result.

> This bot requires some customization to makes it work on different systems.

Required modules: pywin32, mss, PIL and pytesseract.

It also requires [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) binaries to be present.
